# Chorus

Chorus is an open-source web application for large-scale deliberation. It provides tools to help groups voice opinions and find common ground in midst of complexity.

Chorus implements a [pol.is](https://pol.is/home)-like process to collect statements and votes from large numbers of people and analyze it with statistics tools. It can be used to understand common threads of opinion present in a conversation, as well as points of consensus and divergence.

The Chorus project is under active development on a fully volunteer basis by [Chorus Labs](https://github.com/choruslabs), a team of people who met at [Civic Tech Toronto](https://civictech.ca/). This is not a finished product! Expect many rough edges.

If you’re interested in the kinds of problems Chorus is exploring and want to get involved, contributions are very welcome - we’d love your help! If you have a report or idea, please open an issue on GitHub. If you'd like to contribute but not sure where to start, reach out to us through the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/choruslabs/chorus/discussions) page.
